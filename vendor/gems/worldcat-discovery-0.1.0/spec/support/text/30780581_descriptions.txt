From the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus to the later work on ethics and religion, this volume is the only selection of the key works of Wittgenstein -- arguably the emblematic philosopher of the twentieth century. Thematically and chronologically arranged, The Wittgenstein Reader represents the breadth, complexity, and evolution of his thought, from logical atomism to the later work on ethics, life and faith. Taken together, the selections are designed to add up to an overview of Wittgenstein πs philosophical position, and are ideal as a single text for course use. -- Back cover.
